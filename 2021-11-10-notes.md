Notes on the FLP paper

Q1: 

Partial correctness: Validity + agreement

Total correctness: add termination to that

Q2:

Where does the assumption of partial correctness get used in the proof?  In Lemma 2.

Where does the assumption that a process is faulty get used?
Also in Lemma 2, where we discuss a process that takes no steps.

Q3:

One possibility: we can probabilistically solve consensus if all we care about is consensus happening with some arbitrarily high probability.  Also, if we assume a synchronous model.

When else do we encounter situations where something "impossible" becomes possible under slightly less strict requirements?

Exactly-once message delivery.  "Effectively-once" message *processing* is what actually happens.
